# RLSolarSystem
Solar system simulation based on <a href="https://github.com/arinal/WpfSolarSystem">arinal / WPFSolarSystem</a> but swapping WPF for Raylib using <a href="https://github.com/ChrisDill/Raylib-cs">ChrisDill / Raylib-cs</a> bindings for C#.

## To get it up and running:
- Get Raylib_cs package from nuget
- Get Raylib DLL from Raylib releases (follow instructions on Chriss Dill's bindings readme)

Note: This is a just-for-fun project, not meant to be an accurate simulation.
